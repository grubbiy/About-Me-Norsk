# About Me Norsk

A static, single-page "About Me" portfolio in Norwegian with an English toggle. Built for GitHub Pages with no build tools.

## Features
- Light/dark theme toggle with localStorage persistence
- Language toggle using a small JS dictionary
- Honest project status badges and reality-check note
- Mobile-first responsive layout

## Preview locally
Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

## Honesty statement
Project status badges reflect reality (planned, concept, prototype, or in progress). The site is intentionally clear about current skill level and learning progress.
